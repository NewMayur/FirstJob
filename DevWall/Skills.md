# ðŸŒŸ Skills

Measure what matters. Acquiring new skills can skyrocket your professional growth and make your work more productive and enjoyable. ðŸš€

Everyone wants to learn new skills, but there's a big difference between just wanting something and actually working towards it.

This Skills Database is designed to help you organize skills by categories and types. It nudges you to think and understand a skill before dedicating time to learn it. 

Plus, it's the relational part of DevWall where we link skills to the Education&Training table, showing you which courses or books can help you acquire those desired skills.

Dive in, get curious, and start building your skillset today! ðŸŽ“ðŸ“š
