# 🏢 Companies

When researching companies that align with your interests, goals, and other criteria, the Companies template comes into play. 

We'll gather a huge list of companies to look beyond just getting a job. Then we'll rank them based on our current priorities and make connections with people working there for future referrals.

This is just one piece of the job hunt puzzle, but refining your list of target companies is the core of FirstJob.
