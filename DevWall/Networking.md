# 🌐 Networking

In our system, after gaining technical skills and completing projects, the next impactful step is Networking.

Connecting with people who are already in positions we aspire to can help us achieve our goals. This involves creating and nurturing relationships with them.

It's a numbers game: the more people you approach, the higher your chances of building deep connections that can turn into referrals in the future.

But maintaining relationships on this scale isn't easy. That's why we've designed this Networking tracker to help you manage all connections, messages, and follow-up reminders to nurture these relationships effectively.
