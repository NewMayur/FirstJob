# üõ†Ô∏è Project Tracker

Projects are crucial for folks like us who don't have formal software engineering education or professional experience. 
They can be side projects, clones, freelance gigs, pro bono work, or any contributions. 

These projects can make or break your chances of landing a role as a fresher or junior developer.

To help you focus on building while learning, the Project Tracker is here to manage all kinds of projects you work on or dream up. 

We've also created a checklist template to give you a 15% head start when kicking off any project. 

So, let's build, make mistakes, learn, and build again. Good luck!
